#Who will this serve?
This publication would be a data driven publication focusing on current affairs, business, politics, science and popular culture in the form of interactive visual pieces. The publication would be geared towards New Yorkers. As most New Yorkers are consuming journalism on mobile devices while commuting, these pieces should be created to primarily serve that format. 

#What will this look like?
This publication will be similar to the New York Timesâ€™ blog, <i><a href "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot/">The Upshot</a></i>, which often uses data and interactive visuals to provide context to a large story, like how they <a href "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/upshot/taxi-use-patterns-can-tell-us-how-good-the-super-bowl-was.html?rref=upshot">found patterns in New York City Taxi data on Super Bowl Sunday</a> and compared it to what was happening at that moment during the game. This publication would differ from <i>The Upshot</i> in that it would run stories that directly affect New Yorkers on a daily basis, with a very localized scope.

#What kind of stories will run?
Mayor de Blasio <a href "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/nyregion/mayor-de-blasio-to-propose-streetcar-line-linking-brooklyn-and-queens.html">announced this week</a> his intention to implement a 16-mile streetcar line linking Brooklyn and Queens, improving transportation between the two boroughs and eliminating the detour through Manhattan that the current subway routes take. A possible interactive for this publication could allow the user to input an initial address and a destination address to a map, which would then compare the previous route and travel time to the projected route and travel time with the new streetcars. This would provide personalized context to a local news story that affects the <a href "http://web.mta.info/mta/network.htm#statsnyct">7.6 million New Yorkers</a> that use public transportation every day.
